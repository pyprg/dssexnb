    "    - attribute lines, left most detected pattern is an attribute e.g. `P=10` or `Vlimit.min=.98`\n",
    "    - footer, starts with '#.', can also be a header or in the middle\n",
    "    - comments, first character is '#' (hash), second is not '.' (dot)\n",
    "    - blank lines, lines having no other type, they may have characters but are of not any type listed above\n",
    "- leading/trailing underscore characters are not part of IDs\n",
    "- underscores before/after IDs indicate that the entity is not connected to the entity left/right, this is useful for placing injections in one entity line\n",

    "- attribute values follow the equal sign, attribute values must be quoted if they contain space characters\n",
    "- attribute lines are associated to text lines which they follow or preceed without blank lines\n",
    "- blank lines separate entity lines (with their preceeding or following attribute lines)\n",
    "- other characters including space have no meaning and can be used to create a pseudo graphic\n",
    "- attributes are associated to nodes/branches/injections whose IDs sharing the same column like the first character of the attribute name\n",
    "- names of attributes associated to terminals do not share their first column with any entity\n",
